# Github File Downloader

This is a simple Python script to download files directly from GitHub.

## Requirements

To run this script you will need Python and the `requests` library installed on your machine. 

Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

`requests` can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Installation

To download the script, simply clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```
Replace `username` and `repo.git` with your GitHub username and repository name respectively.

## Usage

In the script, replace `'GITHUB_RAW_FILE_URL'` with the direct link to the raw file on GitHub that you want to download.

Also replace `'local_filename'` with the desired file name to save the downloaded file as.

Once you've made these replacements, simply run the script using Python from your terminal:

```bash
python github_file_downloader.py
```
Replace `github_file_downloader.py` with your python filename.

## Example

In this example, we are downloading a requirements.txt file from a repository:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    github_raw_file_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2rayyy/FindChromeDriver/main/requirements.txt'
    local_filename = 'requirements.txt'
    download_file_from_github(github_raw_file_url, local_filename)
```

In this case, the `requirements.txt` file from the GitHub repository will be downloaded and saved as `requirements.txt` in the local directory.

## Error Handling

If any error occurs during the downloading process, it will be caught and an error message will be printed to the console.
